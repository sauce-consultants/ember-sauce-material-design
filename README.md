## Publishing Demo app

The demo app is found in `/tests/dummy/app`. To publish an update to the version of the demo to github you will have to commit a new build to the gh-pages branch and push to github. This can be done easily using the [ember-cli-github-pages addon](https://github.com/poetic/ember-cli-github-pages).

- Make changes to the dummy app in your current branch
- Commit changes
- Run the pages build command `ember github-pages:commit --message "Added new docs for foo"` (This will build the dummy app and commit it to the gh-pages branch)
- Push up the gh-pages branch `git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages`
- Drop Mic
